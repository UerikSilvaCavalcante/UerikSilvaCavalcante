👨‍💻 About Me
Hello, I'm Uerik Saldanha, a Brazilian back-end developer with a passion for technology and innovation. Currently, I work as a junior programmer, applying my skills in Python, C#, JavaScript, and React.js to build efficient and scalable solutions.
I am a fast learner with a knack for handling new technologies and a strong sense of teamwork. I believe programming is a powerful tool for advancing humanity, and I am always looking for new ways to apply it in areas where it has not yet been explored.

🤝 Collaborative: I love helping team members and contributing to collective success.
🎮 Patient and Focused: I stay calm and focused even in challenging situations, and I have a hobby of playing video games.
📚 Curious: I am constantly learning and improving my software development skills.
